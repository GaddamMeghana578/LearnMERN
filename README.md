**Note**: You can either install **MongoDB** locally on your machine or use **MongoDB Atlas**

### Installing

You will need to run client & server seperately, ports are already configured, make sure you don't conflict them if you change anything.

If you are not using **MongoDBAtlas** then do the below:

Start Mongo server in your project directory on a new terminal

```
cd LearnMERN
```

```
LearnMERN/mongod
```

On mac book you need to run

```
LearnMERN/sudo mongod
```

## Enter Server directory on a new terminal

```
cd LearnMERN/server
```

Install the packages on the server

```
LearnMERN/server/npm install
```

OR

```
LearnMERN/server/yarn install
```

Run the server

```
LearnMERN/server/npm start
```

OR

```
LearnMERN/server/yarn start
```

## Enter Client directory on a new terminal

```
cd LearnMERN/client
```

```
LearnMERN/client/npm install
```

OR

```
LearnMERN/client/yarn install

```

Run the application on the client

```
LearnMERN/client/npm start
